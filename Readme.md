# RichEdit jQuery Application

This example is a ready-to-use client jQuery application with the DevExpress [RichEdit](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/400373/office-inspired-controls/controls/rich-edit) component.

## Requirements
* To use the RichEdit control in a jQuery application, you need to have a [Universal, DXperience, or ASP.NET subscription](https://www.devexpress.com/buy/net/).
* Versions of the devexpress npm packages should be identical (their major and minor versions should be the same).

## Quick Start

1. Open the "JS" folder. In the command prompt, download and install npm packages that are used in the application:

```
npm install devextreme devexpress-richedit --save
```

2. In the same folder, create a RichEdit bundle using recommendations from this help topic: [Create a RichEdit Bundle](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/401721/office-inspired-controls/get-started/richedit-bundle#create-a-richedit-bundle)

3. Open the "JS/index.html" file.
